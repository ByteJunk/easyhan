This is a fork of all the hard work by @nikito7, over at https://github.com/nikito7/easyhan

The goal was to expose some different metrics that weren't being captured in the default version by Nikito, and learn more about Modbus, MQTT, Tasmota, and as cool side effect, have some neat widgets in HA.

Feel free to experiment, just don't blame me if you break anything.
